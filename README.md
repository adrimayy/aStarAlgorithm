# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualization

A web-based visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm. This project demonstrates how the A* algorithm navigates a grid to find the shortest path from a start to an end point while avoiding obstacles. Ideal for educational purposes, this visualization allows users to see the algorithm in action and better understand how pathfinding works.

## Demo

Check out a live demo here: [Link to live demo if hosted]

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the A* algorithm navigate through obstacles and find the shortest path.
- **Heuristic-Based Calculations**: The algorithm uses the Euclidean distance heuristic for accurate pathfinding.
- **Step-by-Step Explanation**: Visual feedback explains each step, including calculations for costs and heuristic values.
- **Obstacle Randomization**: Each run generates a unique grid with obstacles, guaranteeing a clear path from start to end.
- **Clear and Simple Interface**: Clean layout and color-coded grid for easy understanding.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** and **CSS3**: For structuring and styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for the A* algorithm and visualization.
- **Canvas API**: Used for rendering the grid and visualization on the screen.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/astar-pathfinding-visualization.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd astar-pathfinding-visualization


3. Open index.html in your preferred web browser to see the visualization in action.

### Usage

	1.	Launch the app by opening index.html.
	2.	Observe the grid with random obstacles generated at each refresh.
	3.	Watch the algorithm find the shortest path from the red start point to the green end point.
	4.	See the explanations for each cell, including calculations for costs and heuristic values.

### Project Structure
       ```
 astar-pathfinding-visualization/
	├── index.html        # Main HTML file for the interface
	├── styles.css        # CSS for styling the visualization
	├── script.js         # JavaScript file containing the A* algorithm logic
	└── README.md         # Project README file

### How It Works

The A* algorithm combines concepts from Dijkstra’s Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. It uses both:

	•	g-cost: The cost from the start to the current cell.
	•	h-cost: The heuristic estimate from the current cell to the goal (Euclidean distance here).
	•	f-cost: The total cost (f = g + h) used to determine the best path.

The algorithm continually evaluates and prioritizes cells with the lowest f cost until it reaches the end or determines there’s no valid path.
